# Introduction

## Databases

>  Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations.

Databases can be stored in different ways:

* On paper

* In your mind

* On a computer

* This repository

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

> A software program that helps users create and maintain a database.

* Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information

* Handles Security

* Backups

* Importing/Exporting data

* Concurrency

* Interacts with software applications

## Types of Database

### Relational Database (SQL)

> Organize data into one or more tables.

* Each table has columns and rows

* A unique key identifies each row


### Non-Relational Database (noSQL)

> Organize data is anything but traditional table

* Key-values store

* Documents (JSON, XML, etc)

* Graphs

* Flexible Tables

## Relational Databases

### Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

> Help users create and maintain a relational database.

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

* Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS

* Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administratives tasks

* Used to difine tables and structures

* SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

## Non-Relational Databases

### Non-Relational Databases Management Systems (NRDBMS)

> Help users create and maintain a non-relational database

### Implementation Specific

* Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set language standard.

* Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing C.R.U.D and administrative operations on the database.

## Database Queries

> Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information. As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more dificult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
